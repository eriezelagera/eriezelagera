  I'm currently doing a simple Credit Card Manager. It is still private as it is still under development.
  
  The goal of it is to compute the how much expense I need to reach the minimum expense for annual fee reversal.
  
  It will also have several useful reports for better credit management.
  
  The project is made by my overall experience doing Java development.
